#### 1. Define artificial intelligence (AI). Find at least 3 definitions of AI that are not covered in the lecture.

Three definitions I've found:

* “The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence
  when performed by people.”

* “The study of the computations that make
  it possible to perceive, reason, and act.”

* “[The automation of] activities that we
  associate with human thinking, activities
  such as decision-making, problem solving, learning ...”

#### 2. What is the Turing test, and how [is it] conducted?

The Turing test is a test designed by Alan Turing in 1950 designed to test a machine's ability to exhibit behaviour that
is indistinguishable from that of a human.

The test is conducted by having a human (the interrogator) conduct a 5-minute text message conversation with either a human or the program
we want to test. After the 5 minutes are up, the interrogator will guess if who they've been chatting with is a real human or a program pretending to be human.
If the program manages to fool the interrogators 30% of time, it will have passed the Turing test.

#### 3. What is the relationship between thinking rationally and acting rationally? Is rational thinking an absolute condition for acting rationally?

Thinking rationally and acting rationally often go together, but are not absolutely bound together. Thinking rationally is trying to reduce problems
to a perfect mathematical representation (logic) and finding a perfect solutions to them. Rational acting is where this thinking hits the real world.
In the real world, the agent's information will not be perfect and thus the problem cannot be reduced down and solved perfectly mathematically.

Acting rationally is not acting out the perfect solution, but rather the best solution possible given imperfect information.

So no, rational thinking is not an absolute condition for acting rationally.

#### 4. Describe rationality. How is it defined?

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines rationality as "The quality or state of being rational". Rational is defined as "Having reason or understanding".
Thus, a valid definition of rationality is: "The quality or state of having reason or understanding."

#### 5. What is Aristotle’s argument about the connection between knowledge and action? Does he make any further suggestion that could be used to implement his idea in AI? Who was/were the first AI researcher(s) to implement these ideas? What is the name of the program/system they developed? Google about this system and write a short description about it.
